### Overall Numbers

The corpus consists of annotated tweets.
Some tweets were set aside and labeled by all annotators working on the language.

| --------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| German    | 2                    | 3447          | 58264   | 47                 | 791                |
| Italian   | 3                    | 8646          | 154371  | 45                 | 758                |

## Collection and Preprocessing

The tweets were randomly sampled from the twitter public stream. They were 
preprocessed by the same preprocessing steps as in [twitter_sentiment_gen](https://github.com/lrei/twitter_sentiment_gen):

 1. Files no identified by twitter as part of the target language were
    discarded;
 2. Tweets with less than 5 tokens were discarded;
 3. Tweets with more than 3 mentions were discarded;
 4. Tweets with more than 2 URLs were discarded;
 5. [langid.py](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) [M11] was used on the tweet text without mentions or URLs and tweets with a target language  probability lower than 70% were discard;
 6. URLs and Mentions were replaced with a pre-specified token;
 7. Tweets were tokenized with a variant of twokenize [C10];
 8. For each language, a random subsample of 10,000 tweets was selected.


*Note*: Some errors seem to exist whereby some URLs are incorrectly tokenized.
This occurred *possibly* because of incorrect handling of truncated retweets.


## Annotation

The Part of Speech tags were pre-annotated using [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern) [S12].
The annotators used a web application that for each document allowed them to
perform both document level and token level annotations. The pre-annotation code
used is available in `code\pretag.py`.

The guidelines are available in the [Guidelines](guidelines.md) file.

Annotators had the option to mark any tweet as Trash (e.g. if the language was
misidentified) or Skip if they were unsure. The selection of a label was made via a "dropdown" menu with all possible options.

## Part of Speech (POS) Tagging Experiment

The baseline used for POS Tagging consists of a UniGram tagger implemented
with NLTK. The UniGram tagger assigns the most likely tag seen for a lower case
token in the training set if there are at least 5 examples. Otherwise it uses 
the most common tag ('NOUN'). Only universal tags were used in the training and
testing of this classifier in order to be comparable with the other classifiers.

The UniGram tagger is trained using the first 70% of the corpus and 
tested on the remaining 30%. This baseline tagger is contained in
`code/experiment.py`.

The other POS Taggers evaluated were:

 - [Stanford POS](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) [T03]
 - [RDRPOSTagger](http://rdrpostagger.sourceforge.net/) [N14]


| Language  | Model                          | Accuracy | Tokens Evaluated |
| --------- |------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| German    | Baseline                       | 0.85     | 14106            |
| German    | Stanford POS (german-hgc)      | 0.69     | 47089            |
| German    | RDRPOSTagger (German)          | 0.70     | 47089            |
| Spanish   | Baseline                       | 0.89     | 31162            |
| Spanish   | Standord POS (spanish-distsim) | 0.13     | 103752           |
| Italian   | Baseline                       | 0.90     | 36708            |
| Italian   | RDRPOSTagger (Italian)         | 0.44     | 123080           |

The results obtained by the baseline were expected (see [C93]). The German
results  are only slightly lower than expected. The results obtained from
other taggers (Spanish and Italian) are significantly below our expectations. The two
hypothesis are that this was due to the difference in tagsets and tokenization.

## Files

### Directories

| Directory     | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| data/         | Contains the original data exported from the annotation tool.           |
| code/         | Contains code for exporting the original data and calculating measures. |
| corpus\_task/ | Usable corpus (non-overlapping) by language and task.                   |
| agreement/    | Overlapping annotations in a format easy for calculating agreement.      |
| experiments/  | Contains the result of the POS tagging experiments.                     |


### Corpus - Usable (corpus\_task/)

The usable corpus consists of the tweets and their annotations, extracted from
the original data and converted into a more or less standard format using
scripts in the `code/` directory.

It does not include the overlapping tweets used to calculate agreement.

#### Sentiment

The sentiment files are in a Tab Separated Values format with the header:

```
id	text	label
```

 * **id** is the twitter provided tweet tweet id.
 * **text** is the text of the tweet
 * **label** is the manually assigned sentiment: 'positive', 'neutral' or 'negative'.

All instances of detected URLs have been replaced with the special token
*TURLTURL*. All instances of usernames have been replaced with *TUSERUSER*. 

These files were generated from the original data using the script
`code/extract_sentiment.py`.

#### Sequence Tagging: Part of Speech and Named Entity Recognition

The Part of Speech and Named Entity recognition files are in the CONLL format
which consists of empty-line delimited sentences (in this case, tweets) where
each non-empty line is a token followed by a space and the tag.



These files were generated from the original data using the script
`code/xlime2conll.py`

All instances of detected URLs have been replaced with the URL
*http://luisrei.com* and all instances of twitter username have 
*@lmrei*.

### Code
Running the code requires python and the pandas library.
The scripts are meant to be run from the base directory.
`twokenize.py` and `pretag.py` are include for reference and are not meant to be
run with the provided data.

Running `experiments.py` required a particular arrangement of the external
dependencies (Stanford POS Tagger and RDRPOSTagger).


```bash
git clone https://github.com/lrei/xlime_twitter_corpus.git
cd xlime_twitter_corpus
python code/stats.py
```
